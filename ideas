Levels
  increase speeds in each level
  increase no of balls to burst per level
    balls requirement
  decrease time for some levels (maybe)
  some balls require multiple clicks (per colour maybe)

Powerups
  three in a row of same color - bonus points
  bomb balls that kill all of same colour on screen (introduce them after 5 levels won)

Pointing
  bursting increases score
  some balls worth more (based on level perhaps?)
